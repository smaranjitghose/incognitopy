# incognitopy

Are you an advocate of privacy? Or a digital activist?



Maybe you don't wish to reveal you were present in some messed up situation



In today's world, as face recognition models are not only improving so fast but also becoming very accesible 
(Check out my [smileplease](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/smileplease) project, where I walk you through the basics)


This raises an acute need for facial anonymity in pictures as well as videos in several scenarios. From causes like national security to getting saved from being reprimanded by your mom for eating those doritos at night, it has become the need of the hour. 


Wondering how to do it?🤔🤔 


I mean without those Photoshop gurus and even in real time footage! (Yes, you read that right. Its possible in real time videos and you right there can do this)

Well, pass a smile 😊 because python🐍 has your back now with another magic spell!

Don't believe me? 🤨

# Results:

Here's what the spell did to my picture:

Convinced..huh? 😉 and want this spell for yourself?

Here you go:

- Make sure you have the lastest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed on your system and its set to path
- Clone this repository ⏬
- Move inside 👉 the repo 
    - Open the Terminal 👩‍💻
    - and type ```cd incognitopy```
- Now make sure you have all the dependencies🧱 
  - type in the terminal
      ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Put your image inside the repo or get its path
- Now, the climax you have been waiting for!😎. Run the script using Terminal 
    - Open the Terminal 👩‍💻
    - and type ```python incognitopy.py -i <path to your input image>``` 
- Press ``q``` to quit
Abracadabra ⚡

# Further Work: 🏗
- Create a script for going incognito in real time using your webcam 
- Use other Deep Learning based face detection models🤓 to get better results
- Use object detection models to detect other objects in the proximity of the face and replace the covered page with last blurred location of the face
- Deploy🚢 the above using TensorFlow.JS or using Flask
- Integrate this into an image processing package
