In today's world, as face recognition models are not only improving so fast but also becoming very accesible 
(Check out my [smileplease](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/smileplease) project, where I walk you through the basics)

This raises an acute need for facial anonymity in pictures as well as videos in several scenarios. From causes like national security to getting saved from being reprimanded by your mom for eating those doritos at night, it has become the need of the hour.
